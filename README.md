# introToVR

Theme: 
  The game will be centered around a character that makes a living out of stealing. He will have different quests in which he will have to make a certain amount of money from the objects he steals. Maybe each object will have a tag that specifies its value, maybe there will be time constraints, I haven't decided yet.
  Luckily I will integrate the LeapMotion sensor in order to grab the objects more realistically :D.
